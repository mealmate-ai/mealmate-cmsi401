Wow, you have done a LOT of work on this!  Good thought shows in the way you
have done the funcitonal breakdown for the CSCI.  There is a *little* too
much detail in that section though.  Once you get to the CSU level, you don't
have to go deeper than that for section 5.2

The requirements section is very good!  One thing to think of is with respect
to the "such as" clauses.  That is where you should use "will" statements to
make that information clear.  An example is in 5.3.1.1.1.2:

5.3.1.1.1.2 Chatbot shall allow users to ask simple questions (i.e. about
            nutrition facts, such as "How much protein is in beef?") and shall
            respond appropriately to such questions.

In reality, this is two requirements AND two "will" statements because of the
"i.e." and because of the "and":

5.3.1.1.1.2 Chatbot shall allow users to ask simple questions about
            nutrition facts.
            User questions will be limited to questions about food, such as
            "How much protein is in beef?"

5.3.1.1.1.2 Chatbot shall respond to such questions with 'appropriate' data.
            The word 'appropriate' indicates that the answer will be from the
            application's database and be pertinent to the question that has
            been asked.

Otherwise, great work!  You have put a lot of effort into this and it shows!
Re-visit some of those requirements as I've discussed here by the end of the
semester's re-submission to get full credit for this work product.

I don't see any project schedule in your repo, though....  Did I miss that?
