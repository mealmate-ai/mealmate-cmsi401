Good thought into these answers!  I see your point about time, but I wonder
where cost fits into that, too... since "time is money" they are related,
which makes me wonder if the rationale of "there was not enough time" is a
cover in some respect [perhaps unconsciously] for development that didn't
go well or didn't get planned well?  Just food for thought....

ON number two you missed "maintenance" which is pretty important.  Usually
70% to 80% of a major software project is taken by maintenance AFTER the
software has been deployed!  ....just sayin'.....

Excellent reasoned answers on eight and nine.  On ten, is that script tool
something that is part of XCode or is it an add-on of some kind?  I don't
know very much about XCode development so I'd be happy to learn more!


Great work on this assignment overall!
