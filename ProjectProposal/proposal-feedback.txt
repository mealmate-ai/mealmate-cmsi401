CoCo 2.0 project [aka "mealmate"]
=================================
Presentation:
   very nice, high-quality presentation!  good use of graphics for emphasis
   and to explain what the application will look like and accomplish.  nice
   to see the comparison between 1.0 and 2.0.  a bit confusing as to the
   actual name of the application; "mealmate" vs. "Coco" etc, but not a hill
   to die on.  great job on this part of the assignment and very clear, clean
   presentation.

Proposal Document:
   the way you detail how each team member brings a skill to the proceedings
   is VERY nice.  looks like you have all you need as a team, and everyone is
   interested in the portion of the project on which they will be working.

   something to consider would be to perhaps allow some time in the schedule
   for team members to work together on portions with which they are NOT as
   familiar, so as to improve their overall skill sets.

=============================================================================
High-quality work on this presentation and proposal!
