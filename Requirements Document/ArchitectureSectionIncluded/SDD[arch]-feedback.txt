=====================================================================================
Wow, this is great!  You really nailed down the descriptions and the amount
of detail you've provided is perfect for architectural level.  The diagrams
are most helpful to aid in understanding the operations and associations.
You have also described the way the parts communicate with each other; that
is something which is commonly missed.

I like the bucket as the storage graphic, and the gateway symbol in the AWS
architecture!  Imaginative.

The only thing to consider is that you should use the present tense, not the
future tense, when describing your design.  For example, in section 6.1.2.1
you state:

One interface will be the chatbot.  Humans can interact with this interface
as if it were an actual nutritionist via text or voice input.  For voice
input, they will press a button on the chatbot page.  Users will be able to
use the chatbot interface.....

....which should be:

One interface is the chatbot.  Humans can interact with this interface
as if it were an actual nutritionist via text or voice input.  For voice
input, they can simply press a button on the chatbot page.  Users can
use the chatbot interface.....

When doing the detailed design, you can address this situation.


Otherwise, VERY nice work on this deliverable!
