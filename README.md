**What is Daily Bites?**

Other nutrition apps require extensive data entry, focus on weight loss or caloric intake (which can actually hinder goals), and have limited functionality. 

Daily Bites is a nutrition app that emphasizes eating a balanced diet rather than caloric intake. It features natural language processing in the chatbot to provide a nutritionist-like experience. Additionally, it includes recommended recipes tailored to each user's diet and preferences.
